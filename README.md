# QA Automation & Docker Project: Kiwi TCMS Workflow

### 🚀 About This Project
This project represents my transition from an operational role to the world of software development and QA Automation. It demonstrates my ability to build a containerized testing infrastructure using **Docker** and develop automation logic via **Bash scripting**.

### 🛠️ Technical Evolution
1. **Mobile Prototyping**: Developed and validated Bash logic on an Android S24 Ultra (via Termux) to test portability.
2. **Infrastructure**: Orchestrated a professional QA environment using **Docker Compose**, featuring Kiwi TCMS and PostgreSQL.
3. **Growth Mindset**: This project is the result of my intensive self-study phase, moving from operational experience to technical implementation.

### 📈 My Goal
I am a junior developer/tester with a strong operational background. I am now focusing 100% on software development. I am looking for a position where I can apply my current knowledge of Docker and Bash while tackling more complex challenges in a professional team.
